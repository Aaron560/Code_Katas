[Are You Playing Banjo?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53af2b8861023f1d88000832)

>Task: <br/>
Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!
The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:


>Example: <br/>
name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"

Names given are always valid strings.
